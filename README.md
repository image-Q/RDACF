# RDACF : A Closed-Loop Decision-Making Framework for Autonomous Driving via Interactive Prediction and Spatiotemporal Risk Propagation
A closed-loop decision-making framework integrating trajectory prediction and adaptive risk-discounting, designed for safe and efficient navigation in mixed traffic scenarios with coexisting Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).
## Core Challenges Addressed
In mixed traffic environments, autonomous decision-making demands accurate multi-step interaction prediction and dynamic risk assessment. Existing methods suffer from three key limitations:
* Neglect of reciprocal influence between ego actions and lack of physical consistency constraints in prediction
* Absence of explicit modeling for spatiotemporal propagation of potential hazards in risk evaluation
* Absence of explicit modeling for spatiotemporal propagation of potential hazards in risk evaluation
# Key Innovations
1. Physically Aware Prediction: Incorporates kinematic plausibility constraints and social regularization to ensure trajectory feasibility and compliance with traffic interaction norms.
