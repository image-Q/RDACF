# RDACF : A Closed-Loop Decision-Making Framework for Autonomous Driving via Interactive Prediction and Spatiotemporal Risk Propagation
A closed-loop decision-making framework integrating trajectory prediction and adaptive risk-discounting, designed for safe and efficient navigation in mixed traffic scenarios with coexisting Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).
